## Musing while learning to meditate

These are a few set of web motion graphics I made while I was learning to meditate back in 2014.
They are not very polished yet they express my understanding of the principles of interdependence (changing forms of water),
No self (the recreation of flame) and transcendence; as I might have understood back them.
